# Mudlet Map Explorer

Adapted from the plugin for [Arkadia](https://arkadia.rpg.pl/)

Original source code available here: https://github.com/Delwing/mudlet-map-reader

I've honestly just translated it from Polish to English and removed the Arkadian branding to make it more Mudlet generic. The original work is excellent and I will be monitoring upstream to pull in additional enhancements as they come.


## Installation

Download the latest mpackage release from https://github.com/demonnic/mudlet-map-reader/releases/latest

If you've installed a previous version, uninstall it from the Package Manager, then install the new version either by using the Package Manager or dragging the file and dropping it onto Mudlet's main screen.

## Use

Just run the alias
```
/explore-map
```
It will then set about exporting the map data and opening your web browser to the index page.
